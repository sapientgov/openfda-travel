[FDA Anywhere Server Build & Deploy Setup]

Overview
--------------
This document provides the steps to setup the FDA Anywhere application build and deployment infrastructure.  Application code is hosted on GitHub. The application is deployed to a Node.js and MongoDB based application architecture hosted on the platform-as-a-service provider, OpenShift.  The continuous integration service, Travis-CI, is used to build and deploy the code.  The build plan on Travis CI monitors the GitHub repository for code check-in on the master branch and automatically kicks off a build that includes running unit tests and deploying code to OpenShift.
Also, we provide instructions for creating a Docker (VM) container that can be deployed to another machine.


OpenShift Setup

1. Create an OpenShift account.( https://www.openshift.com/app/account/new)
2. Follow the instructions here (https://developers.openshift.com/en/getting-started-windows.html or https://developers.openshift.com/en/getting-started-osx.html) to setup the OpenShift command line tools
3. Create an application using a node.js cartridge on Openshift as outlined in the tutorials or on the web interface.
	a. Note that an additional gigabyte of storage may be required for our application, if it is built on OpenShift servers
4. Add a MongoDB cartridge to your application

-If Building on Openshift
	5. Connect your application's git repository and your local copy of the code by setting a remote origin
		a. See the guide here: https://help.openshift.com/hc/en-us/articles/202398470-Sync-new-git-repo-with-your-own-existing-git-repo
	6. Push to the OpenShift repo. The buildhook already present in the repo will build and start the app.

-If Building on Local Machine
	5. Clone the OpenShift application  git repo and setup a local development environment using the readme.md 
	6. Build the application using "grunt" command in the local copy of the code at  https://github.com/sapientgov/openfda-travel
		a. This requires installing grunt-cli with "npm install grunt-cli" and compass with "gem install compass"
	7. Copy the dist folder, package.json, and server.js files  from the local copy of the github repo into the local copy of the OpenShift application repo.
	8. Commit and push the changes. 

-Docker Setup
1. Download and install docker (https://www.docker.com/) 
2. Download the mongo and node cartridges from Docker hub (execute the commands: 'docker pull mongo' and 'docker pull node')
3. Build the fdaanywhere container from the local copy of the code ('cd /path/to/local/repo' and 'docker build -t fdaanywhere .')
4. Start the mongo container ('docker run --name mongo -d mongo mongod --small files')
5. Start the fdaanywhere container and link to the mongo container ('docker run -it -d --name fda --link mongo:mongo -p 8080:8080 fdaanywhere')
6. Access the site at localhost:8080
	- Special Instructions for Mac
	a. In terminal run 'boot2docker ip'
	b. Copy the ip address provided (192.168.59.103 usually)
	c. Go to <ipaddress>:8080
